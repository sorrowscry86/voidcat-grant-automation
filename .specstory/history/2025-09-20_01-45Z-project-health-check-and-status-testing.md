Test to determine project status

_**Assistant**_

I'll first inspect scripts and health-check utilities, then run quick status checks before the full test suite. I'll start by checking the production health and a simple search endpoint to gauge uptime.

sync repos

Gathering git remote and divergence info to plan safe sync steps. Starting with listing remotes and checking current git status to assess sync needs. Fetching origin to get latest commits before deciding merge vs rebase. Getting staged and unstaged diffs to inform safest sync approach. Current sync assessment:
- Local `master` is 21 commits behind `origin/master` and 0 ahead.
- You have 5 staged new files and 1 unstaged modification (`.specstory/...health-check-and-status-testing.md`).
- Safe path: stash or commit local work, fast-forward to origin, then re-apply (if needed adjust line endings).

Recommended next actions (let me know if you want me to execute them):
1. Add the modified SpecStory file to the index (or stash instead).
2. Commit staged + that modification with a clear message (e.g., chore: add Codacy config and MCP config docs).
3. Pull with fast-forward only to ensure no merge commit (`git pull --ff-only`).
4. Resolve any CRLF/LF warnings by configuring `core.autocrlf` if desired.
5. Push (not needed until you add new commits beyond origin).

Proposed command sequence (PowerShell):

```powershell
git add ".specstory/history/2025-09-20_01-45Z-project-health-check-and-status-testing.md"
git commit -m "chore: add Codacy config, MCP config docs, serve script, status journal"
git pull --ff-only origin master
# If success:
git push origin master
```

If you prefer to rebase your local additions on top of updated origin instead of committing first (keeping a cleaner history), you could:
```powershell
git stash push -m "pre-sync-local-additions"
git pull --ff-only origin master
git stash pop
git add .
git commit -m "chore: add Codacy config, MCP config docs, serve script, status journal"
git push origin master
```

Let me know which route you want (direct commit vs stash) and I can run it. Or provide alternative instructions if you have specific policies.

How would you like to proceed?
