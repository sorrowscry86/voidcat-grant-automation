Verify deployment and test for functionality

---

_**Assistant**_

To verify the deployment and run functional tests, I’ll first inspect the project scripts and structure to confirm available test commands and configs, then proceed to hit the live health/search endpoints and run the Playwright E2E tests locally. Results: The workspace has Playwright setup with scripts, a Cloudflare Worker API with deploy scripts, and Playwright config points to static `` via file:// by default; API `package.json` has `deploy`/`dev` scripts. Next, I’ll verify the live API health endpoint and run the full Playwright E2E suite locally, then surface a brief report and artifacts path.
