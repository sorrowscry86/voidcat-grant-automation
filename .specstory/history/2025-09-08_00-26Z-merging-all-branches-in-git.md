merge all branches

---

_**Assistant**_

I need more information before I can proceed. "Merge all branches" is ambiguous. Do you want to merge all local branches into your current branch (`master`)? Or do you mean something else? Please clarify which branches you want to merge and what the target branch should be.

Merge local and remote branches

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand you'd like to merge branches, but I need a bit more information to do it correctly. To start, I will list all the local and remote branches to get a clear picture of the repository. Then you can tell me exactly which branches you want to merge.
