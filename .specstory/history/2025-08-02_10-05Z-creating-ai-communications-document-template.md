# Creating AI communications document template (2025-08-02 10:05Z)

_**User**_

Make AI-comms.md file for this project based on template

---

_**Assistant**_

Plan: I'll scan a few key files to tailor the AI-Comms document to this project (frontend, API, configs), then create `.specstory/AI-Comms.md` based on your template with roles, tools, mandates, and an initial change log noting the "process is not defined" checkout error and remediation steps. I'll create a new `.specstory/AI-Comms.md` tailored to this project, capturing agent roles, tools, protocols, and a change log noting the Stripe checkout "process is not defined" issue with proposed remediation. I'll clean up the new `AI-Comms.md` to satisfy Markdown linting: add blank lines around headings and lists, and convert bare email addresses to mailto links. 
```

```
I’m on it—let’s add a project-tailored AI-Comms hub and capture the checkout error you showed, plus the plan to fix it.

Plan
- Create `AI-Comms.md` based on your template, customized for this repository.
- Document agents, tools, mandates, protocols, and success metrics aligned with this stack (Alpine.js frontend, Hono/Workers API, Stripe).
- Add a change log entry detailing the “process is not defined” Stripe checkout issue with remediation steps.
- Ensure Markdown lint-friendly formatting (headings/lists spacing, no bare links).

What I did
- Added `AI-Comms.md` with:
  - Agent Registry (Albedo, Copilot, VoidCat-API, StripeCat, Securus, DocuCat) and their tools/mandates.
  - Coordination patterns, comms formats, implementation guidelines, and success metrics.
  - Project Change Log entry documenting the Stripe checkout error “process is not defined” on GitHub Pages and a concrete fix plan.
  - Support & Contact block with mailto links and org branding.
- Cleaned Markdown to satisfy common lint rules (blank lines around headings/lists, no bare URLs, final newline).

Stripe checkout issue captured (summary)
- Cause: `index.html` uses `process.env.STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_ID` in the browser; on GitHub Pages, `process` is undefined.
- Plan:
  - API: Add `GET /api/public/stripe-config` returning `{ publishable_key, price_id }` from Worker env.
  - FE: Fetch config during `init()`; use `publishable_key` to initialize Stripe; stop referencing `process.env` in the browser.
  - Keep secret key server-side; price IDs and publishable key are safe to expose.

Files changed
- Created: `AI-Comms.md`

How to view
- Open `d:\Ryuzu Claude\VoidCat-RDC\voidcat-grant-automation\.specstory\AI-Comms.md`.

Completion summary
- AI-Comms hub added and customized for VoidCat RDC.
- Checkout error documented with actionable remediation steps.
- Markdown formatted to pass typical lint checks.

Requirements coverage
- Create AI-comms.md based on template: Done
- Tailor to this project’s stack and workflows: Done
- Include the observed Stripe error and resolution plan: Done
- Keep formatting clean: Done

Next suggested steps (optional)
- I can implement the `GET /api/public/stripe-config` endpoint in `index.js` and update `index.html` to consume it, then add a small Playwright test for the upgrade modal flow. Would you like me to proceed with those changes now?

Take stock of available tools and update copilot-instructions with tools and use cases.

_**Assistant**_

Purpose: I’ll scan the existing instructions and key project configs to enumerate available tools and commands, then update `copilot-instructions.md` with a curated tools list and usage examples tailored to this repo and Windows PowerShell. I’ll update `copilot-instructions.md` with a curated list of project tools, commands, and recommended use cases, tailored for Windows PowerShell and this repo’s stack, to guide future AI assistance.

````
I’ll update the repo’s Copilot instructions with a clear inventory of tools and when to use them, plus PowerShell-ready commands so future automation stays consistent.

Checklist
- Read current instructions and key configs to enumerate tools and flows.
- Add Wrangler, Playwright, Hono, Stripe, Alpine/Tailwind sections.
- Provide common task recipes using Windows PowerShell.
- Call out frontend config guidance (no process.env in browser).
- Include Do/Don’t guardrails and quick links.

What I changed
- Updated file: `copilot-instructions.md`
  - Added “VoidCat RDC – Copilot Operating Guide (Tools & Use Cases)”
  - Cataloged tools: Cloudflare Wrangler, Playwright, Hono, Stripe (server + client), Alpine.js, Tailwind.
  - Provided PowerShell commands for:
    - Local API dev and production deploy with Wrangler
    - Managing Stripe secrets via `wrangler secret put`
    - Running E2E tests and viewing reports
    - Health/search cURL checks
  - Documented current API endpoints plus the planned `GET /api/public/stripe-config` for frontend hydration.
  - Gave frontend guidance to fetch publishable Stripe config at runtime (no `process.env` in browser).
  - Testing guidance tied to `playwright.config.ts` (file:// baseURL) and artifacts.
  - Do/Don’t section for security and workflow hygiene.
  - Quick links to key files.

Why this matters
- Ensures any AI or human contributor uses the correct tools and Windows PowerShell syntax.
- Reduces rework around environment handling, especially Stripe and static hosting constraints.
- Improves reliability of deployments and tests.

How to use
- Open `d:\Ryuzu Claude\VoidCat-RDC\voidcat-grant-automation\.github\copilot-instructions.md` for the curated commands and patterns.
- Follow the “Frontend Guidance” to fix the “process is not defined” issue by fetching `/api/public/stripe-config` instead of using `process.env` in the browser.

Next (optional, I can proceed)
- Implement `GET /api/public/stripe-config` in `index.js`.
- Refactor `index.html` to fetch config on `init()` and initialize Stripe with `publishable_key`.
- Add/adjust a Playwright test to cover the upgrade modal and guard against regressions.

Completion summary
- Tools inventory and use cases documented and aligned with this repo.
- PowerShell commands added for local dev, deploys, secrets, and testing.
- Frontend env pitfalls addressed with an actionable pattern.

Requirements coverage
- Take stock of available tools: Done
- Update copilot-instructions with tools and use cases: Done
