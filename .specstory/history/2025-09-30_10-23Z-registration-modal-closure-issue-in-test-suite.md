# Registration modal closure issue in test suite (2025-09-30 10:23Z)

Run full suite of tests. Headless

The full Playwright E2E test suite ran headless. 37 tests passed, but 21 failed and 4 did not run. The most frequent failure is a timeout waiting for the registration modal to close (`expect(locator).not.toBeVisible()`), indicating the modal remains visible when it should be hidden. This affects usage limiting, registration, and upgrade flows.

**Issue:** Registration modal does not close as expected, causing multiple test failures.
**Impact:** Majorâ€”blocks verification of free tier usage limiting, registration, and upgrade flows.
**Solution:** Review modal close logic in `index.html` and related Alpine.js state. Ensure the modal is properly hidden after registration and usage limit events.
**Verification:** Rerun the test suite after fixing modal close logic; all modal-related tests should pass.

Would you like a prioritized breakdown of failed tests or direct guidance on fixing the modal logic?
