## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] All changes committed to Git
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Tests created (ready for CI/CD)
- [x] No console errors in browser
- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Deployment Steps
1. **Frontend Deployment** (GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages)
   ```bash
   # Changes are in frontend/index.html
   # No build process required (static file)
   # Deploy via Git push (GitHub Pages auto-deploys)
   ```

2. **Verification Steps**
   - [ ] Navigate to live site
   - [ ] Verify dark mode toggle is visible
   - [ ] Click toggle to enable dark mode
   - [ ] Verify all sections display correctly
   - [ ] Reload page and verify preference persists
   - [ ] Test on mobile device
   - [ ] Clear localStorage and verify default is light mode

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor for any user-reported issues
- [ ] Check analytics for dark mode adoption
- [ ] Verify no increase in error rates
- [ ] Confirm page load times unchanged

## Production Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
1. **Adoption Rate**
   - % of users enabling dark mode
   - Time of day patterns
   - Device type correlation

2. **Performance**
   - Page load time (target: no change)
   - Theme switch time (target: <300ms)
   - localStorage access time

3. **User Engagement**
   - Session duration by theme
   - Bounce rate comparison
   - Feature usage correlation

### Error Monitoring
Watch for:
- localStorage quota exceeded errors
- Theme persistence failures
- JavaScript errors related to toggle
- CSS loading issues

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin copilot/add-dark-mode-toggle
```

### Partial Rollback
If only specific issues:
1. Disable toggle button (comment out in HTML)
2. Remove dark mode initialization
3. Keep light mode styling
4. Deploy fix

### Communication Plan
- Inform users via status page
- Provide timeline for fix
- Offer workaround if possible

## Feature Flags (Future Enhancement)

Consider adding:
```javascript
// Feature flag for dark mode
const DARK_MODE_ENABLED = true; // Can be toggled remotely

if (DARK_MODE_ENABLED) {
    // Show dark mode toggle
} else {
    // Hide toggle, use light mode only
}
```

## Known Limitations
