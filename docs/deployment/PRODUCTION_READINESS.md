Absolutely, running tests on the **Live API** is a critical step to ensure your production deployment is fully operational and ready for real users. Hereâ€™s a detailed, actionable guide tailored to your current VoidCat Grant Automation platform, referencing your recent deployment and the established Playwright E2E testing suite.

---

## 1. **Verify Live API Health**

First, confirm the API is up and responding as expected:

```bash
curl https://grant-search-api.sorrowscry86.workers.dev/health
```

You should see:

```json
{"status":"healthy","service":"VoidCat Grant Search API","version":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2025-09-04T12:33:26.196Z"}
```

If this passes, your API is live and ready for further testing.

---

## 2. **Configure Your Test Environment for Live API**

- **Frontend**: The deployed frontend is already configured to use the production API endpoint.
- **Local Testing**: If running tests locally, ensure your environment variables or config files point to the live API base URL (`https://grant-search-api.sorrowscry86.workers.dev`).

---

## 3. **Run Playwright E2E Tests Against the Live API**

Your repository includes a comprehensive Playwright test suite ([tests/e2e](https://github.com/sorrowscry86/voidcat-grant-automation/tree/master/tests/e2e)) that covers all major workflows:

- Main page functionality
- User registration/authentication
- Grant search
- AI proposal generation
- Pro subscription & Stripe integration
- Free tier limits
- Mobile/responsive design
- UI elements

### **Recommended Testing Steps**

#### **A. Quick Smoke Test**

```bash
npx playwright test homepage.spec.ts --project=chromium
```
*Purpose: Quickly validate that the main page loads and basic navigation works.*

#### **B. Core Functionality**

```bash
npx playwright test registration.spec.ts search.spec.ts
```
*Purpose: Ensure user registration, authentication, and grant search features are working.*

#### **C. Revenue System**

```bash
npx playwright test usageLimiting.spec.ts
```
*Purpose: Validate free tier limits, Pro subscription, and Stripe payment integration.*

#### **D. Full Suite**

```bash
npm test
```
*Purpose: Run all available Playwright tests for comprehensive coverage.*

## 4. **Monitor and Interpret Results**

- **Pass/Fail Status**: Review the Playwright report for each test.
- **Artifacts**: Playwright provides screenshots and video recordings for failed tests.
- **Performance Metrics**: Pay attention to API response times and payment processing success rates.

**Targets:**
- Playwright test pass rate: >95%
- API response times: <500ms
- Payment processing success: >99%
- User registration completion: No errors

---

## 5. **Where to Find and Run These Tests**

- **GitHub Actions**: You can trigger these tests in CI/CD ([Actions tab](https://github.com/sorrowscry86/voidcat-grant-automation/actions)).
- **Locally**: Clone the repo and follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sorrowscry86/voidcat-grant-automation.git
cd voidcat-grant-automation
npm install
npm run test:install  # Installs Playwright browsers
npm test              # Runs the full suite
```

---

## 6. **Strategic Rationale**

Running these tests on the live API is essential because:

- It validates the **real, production environment** (not just staging or local).
- Ensures **all integrations** (Stripe, database, AI proposal generation) are working end-to-end.
- Confirms the platform is **ready for customer acquisition** and public launch.
